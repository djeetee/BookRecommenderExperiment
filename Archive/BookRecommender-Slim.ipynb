    "### Approach\n",
    "This notebook outlines my attempts at tackling the book recommendation problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, since we don't have actual ratings of books by users but rather the interaction with the books, I opted to treat the 6 types of interactions as scaled up rating imitating regulr 1-5 star ratings with an interaction of 'dislike getting rated as a '0', all the way to an interaction of 'checkout' being rated as as a '5'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anther potential approach would be to treat this problem as a classification problem. I have not attempted to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see below, I have taken a couple of paths to the solution:\n",
    "1. Considering the problem production-related constraints, I attemted using a simple **Matrix Factorization** method using standard libraries and functions namely **scipy.sparse.linalg's SVDS**. This a simple collaborative filtering exercise where we know some of the ratings (in our case, pseudo-ratings) and we're trying to uncover latent features. The big question here is determining the 'k' factor. As noted in the code below, I have not attempted to optimize the algorithm to find an optimal 'k'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Having worked on a similar problems using **Neural Net** (using the **Keras** library with **Tensorflow** as the backend) with pretty reasonable performance, I attempted to apply that approach to this problem by providing multiple models including a simple NNMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "With the exception of one NN, I have not used any explicite data features. One NN model, I complemented the latent features with the inclusion of the books' **Author and YearOfPublication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-life scenario, we're always be faced with the problem of providing recommendations to new users to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This could be mitigated using a number of methods from beefing up the user profile with preferences to finding recommendations based on similar users, best sellers, new books, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results\n",
    "The results were a mixed bag. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Generally, one should start with looking at the data, the approach and then the algorithms/models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the NN models, overfitting seemed to be a problem across the different model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the data (and its sparcity) played a huge role. Taking the same models and applying them to similiar-ish data such as the MovieLens dataset would yield a more consistent results. So that could mean that the data is odd is some to-be-determined way or the approach (treating the interactions as ratings) is not a good one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also could be that the model parameters need further tuning or simply that there is something wrong with code. In both case, more time for further investigation could yield better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best result (although the numbers look very suspicious) was obtained using Model 0 (SVD) with a resulting predictions table shape (17252, 21128) which will create a massibe multi-GB file."

    "### General notes\n",
    "As noted above, the results are a mixed bag which could attributed to one or many reasons:\n",
    "- limited time for testing and finetuning\n",
    "- available processing power \n",
    "- data quality & consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, I attempted to simulate a clean-data environment. To that end, I limited my dataset to a normalized subset (from the events.csv) satisfying the following 2 conditions:\n",
    "- the books must exist in the books.csv\n",
    "- the users must exist in the users.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "I could blame lack of time for a number of things that could and should have been better with the code below, but in all honesty i only had about a day to work on this. This is not the most elegant code: inefficient use of memeory (lots of pd dataframes), df joinging/merging is a bit convoluted. However, I thouroughly enjoyed it.\n"
